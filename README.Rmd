mlfilms
=======

Calculation of reflection from multilayer films using the transfer matrix method.

This package uses the transfer matrix method outlined in [Pedrotti, Pedrotti and Pedrotti](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Optics-3rd-Frank-Pedrotti/dp/0131499335) to calculate the reflection and transmission of plane polarised light from an arbitary stack of thin films.

To Install
----------

From within an R session, use the devtools package like so:
```r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

install_github('tjconstant/mlfilms')
```

The Stack
----------

All stacks are defined as a list of parameters, with the layers listed sequentially from top (incident side) to bottom (exit side). 
For Example:

```r
mystack <- list(index=c(1,1.5,1,1.5+0.5i),thickness=c(100e-9,50e-9,20e-9,100e-9), repetitions=1)

```

Example
-------
As a quick example, here is how you'd calculate and plot the reflection from a thin silver film through a prism. This is a standard experiment in our lab which results in a reflectivity minima associated with a surface plasmon excitation.

We simply construct a stack with an appropriate refractive index and thickness (45 nm), and calculate the reflection (the default covers an angle between 0 and 90 degrees), with incident medium set to glass.

```r
layers <- list(index = c(0.13+4i), 
               thickness = c(45e-9),
               repetitions = 1)

R_plasmon <- angle_scan(incident_medium.index = 1.5+0i,
                        exit_medium.index = 1+0i,
                        layers = layers)
```

Plotting the result using `ggplot` shows a critical edge related to the onset of total internal reflection in the prism, and the reflectivity minima resulting from a surface plasmon excitation on the silver/air interface.

```r
library(ggplot2)

qplot(R_plasmon$angle*180/pi,R_plasmon$Reflection,geom="line")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0))+
  xlab(expression(polar~angle~theta~(degree)))+
  ylab("reflection")
```
